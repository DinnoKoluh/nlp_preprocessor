Dear Er-Go staff,
Unfourtanetly, my ISEE for the MIUR contribution was rejected and the rejection email said:
"Con la presente, le comunichiamo che i controlli di Er.Go. hanno dato esito negativo in relazione 
al suo ISEE, che risulta RESPINTO, con la seguente motivazione: Stato famiglia e documentazione immobiliare 
del padre non adottati da autorità competente e non del 2022. Manca documentazione su possesso/non possesso
 immobili in capo a madre."

To give you some context, I come from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Here are my questions:
1. So, from what I got, one of the missing documents is the one saying that my mother 
doesn’t have any properties registered on her. Here in Bosnia, a document in such a form 
doesn’t really exist, but if it is fine, she can make a declaration saying that she doesn’t
 have any properties on her, and that declaration can be certified in the local municipality
  where we live. I did something similar for the declaration that my sister doesn’t have a job 
  and apparently there was no problem with that. So, please let me know if that will be fine if 
  I do the same thing for my mom’s documents (you can look at my sister’s document to see how it looks).
