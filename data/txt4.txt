It would be unfair to demand that people cease pirating files
 when those same people aren't paid for their participation in
  very lucrative network schemes. Ordinary people are relentlessly
   spied on, and not compensated for information taken from them. 
While I'd like to see everyone eventually pay for music and the like, 
I'd not ask for it until there's reciprocity.
