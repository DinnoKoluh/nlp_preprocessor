The train-test split procedure is used to estimate the performance of machine 
learning algorithms when they are used to make predictions on data not used to train the model.

It is a fast and easy procedure to perform, the results of which allow you to 
compare the performance of machine learning algorithms for your predictive 
modeling problem. Although simple to use and interpret, there are times when 
the procedure should not be used, such as when you have a small dataset and 
situations where additional configuration is required, such as when it is used for classification and the dataset is not balanced.

In this tutorial, you will discover how to evaluate machine learning models using the train-test split.
